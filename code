   - title: Detection Engineering with Sigma
     short-description: Learn how to write and tune Sigma rules to find evil in logs using real-world examples that take you through the detection engineering process.
     description: | 
      Learn the detection engineering process from initial detection gap identification to deploying your rule into production.
      Write your own detection rules using familiar log sources like Windows Events, Zeek Logs, Sysmon Logs, AWS CloudTrail logs, and more.
      Understand the structure of Sigma rules, including the difference between lists and maps, how condition expressions work, and all the essential metadata that’ll be useful for investigating alerts it generates.
      Utilize a rule development environment using the SOC Prime Sigma UI plugin for Kibana to develop rules with a graphical editor and use the Sigma command-line tools.
      Leverage Sigmac to convert rules to popular investigation and detection tool formats like Splunk, Kibana, and others.
      Learn to write resilient rules that find more evil, stand the test of time, and cause headaches for adversaries.
      Operationalize your Sigma knowledge by learning how to manage your custom ruleset with Git and share your rules.

   - title: Building Intrusion Detection Honeypots
     short-description: Intrusion Detection Honeypots rely on deception to trick attackers into interacting with fake systems, services, and data. In this class, you’ll get hands-on experience designing, building, deploying, and monitoring honeypots to detect network adversaries before they accomplish their goals.
     description: | 
      Use the See-Think-Do framework to integrate honeypots into your network and lure attackers into your traps. If you control what the attacker sees and thinks, you can control their actions. This strategy is the key to deceptive defense. 
      Leverage honey services that mimic HTTP, SSH, and RDP and alert you when attackers attempt to connect to them.
      Hide honey tokens and web bugs in office documents. When attackers interact open them, you’ll know they’re on the network.
      Embed honey credentials in services and memory so that attackers will find and attempt to use them. You’ll leverage various forms of authentication monitoring to know when this happens. 
      Build deception-based defenses against common attacks like Kerberoasting and LLMNR spoofing
